## Overview 

Neuroimaging is a broad field and includes many different imaging modalities and approaches, all with complementary attributes. We are mainly using MRI and Nuclear Medicine techniques to help solve a wide range of clinical problems, across the human lifecourse, from neonates to old-age. This overview will answer the following questions: 
- What is clinical neuroimaging? 
- Why use imaging in research? 
- What different techniques are available to us? To include an introduction to: 
  - Functional MRI 
  - Diffusion MRI 
  - Perfusion/arterial spin labelling 
  - Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI 
  - Quantitative susceptibility mapping 
  - MR spectroscopy 
  - Nuclear medicine techniques – SPECT/PET 
- What imaging research infrastructure do we have in Southampton and who is involved? 
- What are our academic interests in neuroimaging? 
- What questions are we trying to answer (case studies)? 
- What are our future directions?
