title: "SPECT & PET Neuroimaging, Quantification & AI in Dementia & Movement Disorder"
teaching: 55
exercises: 0
instructor:
- Sofia Michopoulou
objectives:
- An introduction to SPECT and PET neuroimaging in dementia and movement disorder
keypoints:
- Perfusion SPECT and FDG-PET are routinely used in diagnosis and differentiation of dementia types 
- Amyloid and Tau PET can provide early insights into Alzheimer’s Disease 
- Brain quantification applied to SPECT or PET enables objective diagnosis 
- There is a rapid growth in AI studies for neuroimaging, but little implementation into clinical application 
- In nuclear medicine, AI and particularly deep learning shows promise for early diagnosis of dementia prior to the onset of symptoms 
- Validation studies using independent datasets are required to assess generalisation of AI

## Overview

This lesson will discuss the use of nuclear medicine methods in brain imaging and review the recent literature on artificial intelligence (AI) for dementia diagnosis.
