## Overview

The following topics will be introduced: 
- Who are, and what is Scientific Computing? 
- The importance of quality & safety – Medical Devices 
- Best practices in developing software 
- The impact of AI in clinical software development 
- Examples of what we do: e.g. automating neuroimage-processing to support dementia diagnosis 
- Further training suggestions
