### Overview

This module is offered through the [University of Southampton International Summer School](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/international_summer_school), under the theme "[Challenges in Medicine](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/international_summer_school/themes/challenges-in-medicine/medicine-homepage.page)". The module will showcase the collaboration between the University of Southampton and University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust (UHS) in translational neuroimaging research. 

**Who:** The module is aimed at medical undergraduate students and other researchers. **No prior knowledge of programming is required for attending this module.** You will gain some experience and understanding of how programming is applied in neuroimaging to address different questions in clinical research.

**Venue:** Room 5011, Centenary Building, University of Southampton Highfield Campus [[Info](https://data.southampton.ac.uk/room/100-5011.html)] [[Google Map](https://goo.gl/maps/j8LHUFS6wt9zcNGHA)]

**When:** 19-28 July, 2022. Nine hours will be divided into three morning/afternoon sessions delivered by teams of staff/PhD students from the University and UHS.
 - **Day 1:** Tuesday 19 July 2022, 1:30PM-4:30PM  
 - **Day 2:** Thursday 21 July 2022, 9:30AM-12:30PM   
 - **Day 3:** Thursday 28 July 2022, 5PM-8PM

This module is a part of the training curriculum from
the [ReproNim](http://www.reproducibleimaging.org) (Reproducible Neuroimaging) Center. The [template](https://github.com/repronim/module-template) for all
ReproNim modules is based on the templates of
[Neurohackweek]({{site.nhw_site }}), [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }})
and [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) workshops.

### Objectives
 1. Excite students about opportunities that exist to use advanced neuroimaging techniques (MRI, SPECT, PET) and analysis methods to answer key clinical research questions. 
 2. Explain the research journey from image acquisition to data analysis/quantification and eventually to clinical translation.
 3. Explore the challenges and solutions at each stage.
